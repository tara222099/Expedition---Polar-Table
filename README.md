The Polar Table, which is calculated logically, is different from the actual values, so our goal is to generate a Polar Table based on actual measurements.
The Polar to use as a base is either one generated by the ORC Sailor Service or one generated from the values published by Pogo Structure.
We measure performance using Expedition in areas and at times when the effect of the current is small, and gradually add actual measurements to the log and update it.
